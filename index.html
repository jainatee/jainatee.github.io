<h1>Portfolio</h1>
<p>
	This is Jaina's portfolio. I'm looking forward to adding more links of my work and expanding my knowledge of front-end web development. I think learning the basics will make me a well-rounded designer. I'll be able to easily prototype rough ideas instead of resorting to static wireframes. I'll be able to contribute more efficiently to the marketing team as we create new landing pages and improve the sales pipeline, send out more emails that resonate with clients, and consistently update our web page. So far, it's been really interesting and I'm excited about challenges and working on the final project.
